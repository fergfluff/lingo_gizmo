Meaning Maker 

A game played over time by people in a loose community.
- Share meanings that don't have words yet, such as feelings, experiences, or situations.
- Use your hands to build original words out of the components of a mouth that belong to these as-of-yet unnamed experiences, situations, feelings and meanings.
- Vote on people's meanings and words.
Will people build culture differently if asked to define shared meanings with self-made lingo or slang? 
How much does the physical sensations of words in one's mouth play in the formation of the human language? 

This is my final for Intro to Physical Computing at ITP (Interactive Telecommunications Program), a graduate program at NYU.
