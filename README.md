The Lingo Gizmo for a Missing Dictionary

A collaboration by people over time to create a missing dictionary of our experiences that don't have words... yet. This is my first semester final for Intro to Physical Computing and Intro to Computational Media while at ITP (Interactive Telecommunications Program), a graduate program at NYU.

Submit meanings that don't have words yet, such as feelings, experiences, or situations.
Invent original words out of a fabricated mouth, teeth and tongue, or online with your computer.

The current prototype allows you to invent a word and define it all in one interaction.

You can see what the interaction in person looks like over here: http://www.itpblogelizabethferguson.com/2017/12/20/final-documentation-of-lingo-gizmo/

Questions:
*Will people feel more connected if they discover someone else shares the same experience as them, now that it is written and given its own word?
*How much does the physical feeling of a word in one's mouth play into the mapping of meaning onto words?
